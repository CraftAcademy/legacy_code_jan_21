# Moderation API 
# Challenge  
Your challenge is to the test the existing code base and potentially add new features.  
Make sure to follow the AUT cycle when writing your tests.    
### User Stories 
**Basics**
As a user  
In order to get my text profanity-checked  
I need the app to analyse my text   

As a user  
In order to understand the analysis  
I need the text-analysis-response to tell me whether my text is clean  or profane - and to what degree.  

As an app  
In order to function correctly  
It needs to return proper error code on wrongful use  

As a user  
In order to get my image profanity-checked  
I need the app to analyse my image   

As a user  
In order to know if my image is profane or not  
I need the app the respond with a tag and a percentage.  

**Next Step**

As a user  
In order to have multiple lines of text analyzed  
I should be able to pass in an array of texts   

As an app  
In order to return analyses on each text in an array  
The response should contain an array of each analysis  

**New Functionality**

As a user  
In order to view the last 5 analyses made on the app  
I need my GET request to respond with 5 latest analyses  

**UI**

As a normie
In order to send a request
I need to pass my request in through HTML

As a normie 
In order to view the response
I need the app to render the response in HTML
